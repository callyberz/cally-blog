# What are React Server Components?

React Server Components (RSC) offer a new way to build React applications that enables server-side rendering capabilities in a more efficient manner. This innovative approach allows parts of a React application to be rendered on the server, which are then streamed and rehydrated on the client.


## Benefits of RSC

- **Performance Improvements:** By offloading rendering to the server, RSC can significantly improve the performance of web applications, especially on devices with limited processing power.
- **Enhanced Data Fetching:** RSC allows for direct backend data fetching, simplifying the overall data management strategy.
- **Reduced Client-Side Code:** This approach minimizes the amount of JavaScript needed on the client side, leading to faster load times.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)
- by default use SSG to build
- no server is involved
- custom API endpoints are normally handled by Vercel Serverless Functions
- when building the project, it runs/renders the code (component) and caches the result in a built folder
- host on any node server (next start) or docker
- deploy to any node server and host it using `next start`

## Static export
- an OG way to host a web page
- nextjs provides a way to static export (does the same thing as SSG), where RSC will be called at build time, then cache and write the result in a file
- we dont care about client component as it is dynamic (most likey some random response from 3rd party endpoints)
- how to build it? create a single HTML entry point, host HTML/CSS/JS assets to CDN/S3/Github Pages e.g.
- eg: by adding `output: export`

- then run npm run build, out/ will look like this

- we can host this `index.html` as the single point using AWS, Github Pages, Wix, even locally
- install Live Server on VSCode https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
- copy all the files in `out/` then host using Live Sever
- RSC will be called at build time
- client component: if the app has routes, simply host this `index.html` will not work if it is not a SPA
  - As SPA will navigate to different routes on the client
- you are good to go!
- ❌❌❌ Dynamic endpoints/functions are not supported in static export
