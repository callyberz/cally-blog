  In a modern day web application, we often need to update the UI based on the
  server's state in real-time, especially for AI-related application, the UI
  needs to be updated as soon as the AI model generates a response. The problem
  is how to implement this? <b>WebSocket</b>? <b>Long polling</b>?{' '}
  <b>Server-sent events (SSE)</b>?

> Server-Sent Events (SSE) offer a straightforward way to push real-time updates from the server to the browser, making them an excellent choice for certain use cases where one-way communication is sufficient. Let’s explore how SSE works, where it shines, and how to implement it effectively.

## What Are Server-Sent Events?

SSE is a protocol built on top of HTTP that allows servers to send updates to clients over a single persistent connection. It’s perfect for scenarios where the server needs to broadcast updates without requiring constant polling by the client.

Unlike WebSockets, which provide full-duplex communication, SSE is inherently one-way (server-to-client). This simplicity reduces overhead and complexity, making it an attractive choice for many real-time applications.

## How Does SSE Work?

When using SSE, the browser initiates a connection to the server using the `EventSource` API. The server then keeps the connection open, sending updates as needed in a stream of text-based messages.

Here’s a quick overview:

1. The client creates an `EventSource` instance pointing to a server endpoint.
2. The server responds with a stream of messages using a special MIME type: `text/event-stream`.
3. The client processes these messages, updating the UI or performing other actions.

## Key Features of SSE

- **Automatic Reconnection**: SSE automatically reconnects if the connection is lost.
- **Message Delivery Guarantees**: Messages include IDs to ensure clients can resume from the last received event.
- **Custom Events**: SSE supports custom event types beyond the default `message`.

## When to Use SSE

SSE is ideal for:

- **Live Notifications**: Broadcasting updates, such as chat messages or alerts.
- **Real-Time Dashboards**: Keeping UI elements updated with live data.
- **Event-Driven UIs**: Reacting to server-side events as they occur.

If you need real-time updates without the complexity of WebSockets, SSE is often the better choice.

## Implementation: Client Side (Typescript)

Here's a simple client-side example:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const eventSource = new EventSource(EVENT_SOURCE_URL)
  eventSource.addEventListener('open', () => setIsConnected(true))

  // we can subscribe to different events here by passing different event names
  eventSource.addEventListener('message', (event) => handleNewEvent(event.data))
  eventSource.addEventListener('error', () => {
    setIsConnected(false)
    eventSource.close()
  })
  return () => eventSource.close()
}, [])
```

❗ Reminder: use `addEventListener` is better because adding multiple listeners is feasible while you cannot write multiple `onmessage` handlers cuz it will override the previous one

## Implementation: Server Side (NodeJS)

The server sends messages in a specific format:

```
data: This is a message
id: 123
event: customEvent

data: Another message
```

Here's an example in expressJS. I want to poll the pokeapi every 2 seconds and send the response to the client.

```typescript
app.get('/events', (req, res) => {
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/event-stream')
  res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-cache')
  res.setHeader('Connection', 'keep-alive')

  let offset = 0
  const intervalId = setInterval(async () => {
    try {
      if (offset > 5000) {
        clearInterval(intervalId)
        res.end()
        return
      }

      const response = await fetch(
        `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=10&offset=${offset}`,
      )
      const data = await response.json()
      res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify(data)}\n\n`)
      offset += 10
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error)
    }
  }, 2000)

  // Clean up on client disconnect
  req.on('close', () => {
    clearInterval(intervalId)
    res.end()
  })
})
```

We can send different events to the client by writing different `data:` lines, e.g.

```typescript
// nodejs
res.write(`event: pokemon\ndata: ${JSON.stringify(data)}\n\n`)
// react
eventSource.addEventListener('pokemon', (event) => handleNewEvent(event.data))
```

## Result

## Comparing SSE with WebSockets

| **Feature**        | **SSE**                    | **WebSockets**                                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Communication Type | One-way (server-to-client) | Full-duplex                                        |
| Complexity         | Simple                     | More complex                                       |
| Browser Support    | Widely supported           | Supported but requires fallback for older browsers |
| Use Case           | Notifications, live feeds  | Chat, gaming, interactive apps                     |

## Limitations of SSE

- **One-Way Communication**: If two-way communication is required, WebSockets are a better choice.
- **Connection Limitations**: Browsers limit the number of simultaneous connections to a domain, which may affect scalability.
- **HTTP/2 Challenges**: SSE works well with HTTP/1.1 but doesn't utilize HTTP/2 multiplexing effectively.

## Conclusion

Server-Sent Events provide a simple yet powerful way to build real-time applications. They shine in use cases where one-way updates from the server to the client are sufficient, like live notifications or dashboards. While they may not replace WebSockets for two-way communication, their ease of use and reliability make them a go-to solution for many real-time scenarios.
